                This problem means that
                women's discoveries are
                often ignored or given to
                male colleagues instead.
                The name honors
                Matilda Joslyn Gage, a
                women's rights activist.
                In 1883, she spoke out
                about men taking credit
                for women's ideas. In
                1993, historian Margaret</p>

            <p class="article__txt__item">Rossiter studied this problem. She built on the work of Robert Merton from the 1960s. He had found that one person often
            gets all the credit for a discovery, leaving out their team. Rossiter showed that this problem is much worse for women.
            In the early 1900s, Calkins changed how we understand memory. She created the paired learning method. She showed that
            bright things are easier to remember. She also showed that seeing something many times is most important. These ideas
            are still true today.

            <p class="article__txt__item">In 1895, she passed all her tests for a doctorate at Harvard. A group of six professors, including the famous William
            James, all voted yes. But Harvard still said no and refused to give her the degree. Other psychologists quickly started
            using her method. But slowly, her name disappeared from their work. Today, Google Scholar shows 368,000 results about
            this method. But her original work has only been mentioned 200 times. That's only 0.05%.</p>
            <p class="article__txt__item">Even though people recognized her work while she was alive, today she is remembered as the woman Harvard refused. She is
            not remembered as the scientist who discovered basic facts about memory.</p>
